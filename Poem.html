        My life was bland - a subconscious routine.<br>
        Was I alive? Surely wasn't living.<br>
        Wasting time as an introverted teen,<br>
        The <a href="Darkness.html">darkness</a> I felt was unforgiving.<br><br>

        Minding my business when you said hello.<br>
        Startled, I froze. Felt awkwardly exposed.<br>
        My pulse getting louder, time moved so slow.<br>
        Monochrome shattered and <a href="Twilight.html">twilight</a> arose.<br><br>

        Just another girl I'd pass by, I thought.<br>
        Proved me wrong as you kept showing me more.<br>
        To light my world, your company I sought.<br>
        To show me <a href="Colors.html">colors</a> I've not seen before.<br><br>
    
        And so you may never forget how you touched my life, I made this <a href="index.html">poem.</a>
